# Robotics Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in robotics,
starting from simulation fundamentals and building toward more advanced
robotics systems.

## Current Focus
- Robot simulation using MuJoCo
- Joint-level control and motion
- Understanding kinematics through hands-on experiments

## Progress
### Day 1 One-joint arm simulation (MuJoCo)
- Set up MuJoCo on macOS
- Built and simulated a one-joint robotic arm
- Implemented position control to swing the arm in simulation

Why this repo exists

I am building practical robotics intuition with a long-term goal of
working in robotics product roles (e.g., surgical robotics, manipulation
systems). This repo emphasizes learning-by-doing and clear documentation
over polished demos.
